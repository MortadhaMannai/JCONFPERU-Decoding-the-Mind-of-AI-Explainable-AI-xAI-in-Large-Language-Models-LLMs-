Welcome to the repository for the presentation *"Decoding the Mind of AI: Explainable AI (xAI) in Large Language Models (LLMs)"* delivered by **Mortadha Manai** at JCONF PERU 2024. This repository contains the slides, code examples, and supplementary materials used during the session.

## 📋 Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Gemini are revolutionizing AI by enabling natural language understanding and generation. However, their complexity and lack of transparency raise concerns about trust, fairness, and ethical use. This presentation focuses on Explainable AI (xAI) techniques to make LLMs interpretable and reliable.  

### Key Topics:
1. Introduction to LLMs  
2. The Importance of Explainable AI (xAI)  
3. xAI Techniques for LLMs (e.g., Attention Maps, SHAP, Saliency Maps)  
4. Bias Detection and Mitigation  
5. Practical Debugging Examples  
6. Ethical and Reliable AI
